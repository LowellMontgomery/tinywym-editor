Convert WordPress's WYSIWYG editor into a WYSIWYM editor. Add and edit any HTML tag and attribute from the visual editor.

== Description ==

tinyWYM Editor was created to help inexperienced WordPress users create cleaner, more semantic markup, and to avoid some the pitfalls of WordPress's standard WYSIWYG editor. It does this by labelling and highlighting all HTML elements in the editor, creating a visual representation of the HTML being generated.

tinyWYM Editor also gives more experience users all the control and flexibility of the text editor without having to leave the visual editor. Create and edit any HTML element, add attributes, and wrap or unwrap elements all from the visual editor.
